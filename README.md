CENTIPEDE

According to game theory, Centipede game was first developed in 1981 by Edd LOGG and Donna BAILEY in the years when Arcade games peaked.
Centipede is one of the best known arcade games.
The specific concept in the game is as follows:

Centipede: This centipede can be divided into games. "Centipede" is not such a chosen symbol. It represents divisibility 40 times.

• Flea: Flea
• Trackball: Acts as a navigation for arcade games.
• Independence: Differences bring harmony from perspective
                          - Centipede moves horizontally.
                          - The spider can move diagonally and jump in the pattern at the bottom.

• Centipede - Mushroom relationship
Fungi accelerates the development of
Centipede Centipede -> Mushroom

• Spider - Mushroom relationship
Spider mushrooms eat.
Instead of shooting to kill the spider, the spider eats more mushrooms.

• Scorpio - Mushroom relationship
Scorpio mushrooms poison.
When Centipede touches a poisonous mushroom, it goes out vertically.
Scorpio does not collide with the player and cannot kill him.

• Flea - Mushroom relationship 
If the flea goes down, it releases new fungi.
Fleas come only if there are a small number of mushrooms.

• Each character in the game has mushrooms and unique situations and relationships.
• It is to cope with these relationships expected from the player.
• Adrenaline: Shoot 2 times to kill fleas.
                      If Centipede is destroyed, it will have to deal with 2 different Centipede.
                      If Centipede reaches the bottom of the game screen, the new Centipede will    
          breed.
          The player will try not to give Centipede this chance.
          Mushrooms narrow the playing field.
          When 5000 points are reached, the speed of the hour hand will be 2 times.
          The narrowing of the player's area will cause an increase in adrenaline.
          The player will want to play again to experience this feeling again.
